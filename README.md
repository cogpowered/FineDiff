FineDiff
========

Originally written by Raymond Hill ([https://github.com/gorhill/PHP-FineDiff](https://github.com/gorhill/PHP-FineDiff)) FineDiff has been tweaked to bring it up to date with the modern world. That means documented, nicely formatted, tested code that can be easily extended.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cogpowered/FineDiff.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cogpowered/FineDiff)

Installation
------------

**Composer**

The preferred way of using FineDiff is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

Add the following to your composer.json file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "cogpowered/finediff": "0.3.*"
    }
}
```

Upgrading
---------

**0.3.x** introduces a backwards incompatible version, so if you have stored opcodes do not upgrade!

`0.3.x` fixes a double encoding issue that generates a longer opcode than is needed.

Usage
-----

**Render HTML**


Render as HTML the difference between two strings:

```php
$diff = new cogpowered\FineDiff\Diff;
echo $diff->render('string one', 'string two');
```

This would then output:

```html
string <ins>tw</ins>o<del>ne</del>
```

You could change the granularity to `cogpowered\FineDiff\Granularity\Word` so the output is:

```html
string <del>one</del><ins>two</ins>
```

You do this by passing it into the Diff constructor:

```php
$granularity = new cogpowered\FineDiff\Granularity\Word;
$diff        = new cogpowered\FineDiff\Diff($granularity);
```

**Grab opcode instructions**

Opcode instructions are what tell FineDiff how to change one string into another.

```php
$diff = new cogpowered\FineDiff\Diff;
echo $diff->getOpcodes('string one', 'string two');
```

This would then output:

```html
c7d3i3:two
```

Render text using the opcodes:
```php
$render = new cogpowered\FineDiff\Render\Text;
echo $render->process('string one', 'c7d3i3:two');
```

Would output:
```html
string two
```

Same with HTML:
```php
$render = new cogpowered\FineDiff\Render\Html;
echo $render->process('string one', 'c7d3i3:two');
```
